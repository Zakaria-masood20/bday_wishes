## Quick Deploy to Vercel

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

git branch -M main
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it: `birthday-celebration`
4. Make it **Public** (required for free Vercel deployment)
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/birthday-celebration.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Deploy on Vercel

2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your `birthday-celebration` repository

```

## Troubleshooting

### If images don't load:
- Check that all image files are in the `images/` folder
- Verify file paths in `index.html` start with `images/`

### If audio doesn't work:
- Check that the audio file is in the `audio/` folder
- Verify the audio path in `index.html` starts with `audio/`

### If deployment fails:
- Make sure all files are committed to Git
- Check that the repository is public (for free Vercel)
- Verify all file paths are correct

## Custom Domain (Optional)

After deployment, you can:
1. Go to your Vercel/Netlify dashboard
2. Add a custom domain
3. Configure DNS settings

## Share Your Site

Once deployed, you can:
- Share the URL on WhatsApp, social media, or email
- The site works perfectly on mobile devices
- All animations and effects will work as expected
